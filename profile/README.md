## What is Fusion 360?

**Fusion 360** is a comprehensive, cloud-based platform developed by Autodesk that integrates **CAD, CAM, CAE, and PCB software** into a single, powerful solution. It is designed for product development, offering professional-grade tools for 3D modeling, simulation, generative design, and manufacturing. Unlike traditional CAD software, Fusion 360 provides a unified environment where designers, engineers, and machinists can collaborate seamlessly on complex projects.

With Fusion 360, users can create detailed 3D models, perform advanced simulations, generate toolpaths for CNC machining, and even design electronic circuits. Its cloud-based nature ensures that your work is always accessible, up-to-date, and secure, enabling real-time collaboration across teams. The software is widely used in industries such as industrial design, mechanical engineering, and prototyping, making it an essential tool for professionals and hobbyists alike.

Fusion 360 supports parametric, direct, surface, and mesh modeling, allowing for unparalleled flexibility in design. Its generative design capabilities help optimize parts for weight, strength, and material usage, while its simulation tools enable users to test and validate designs under real-world conditions. Whether you're designing a simple component or a complex assembly, Fusion 360 provides the tools you need to bring your ideas to life.
